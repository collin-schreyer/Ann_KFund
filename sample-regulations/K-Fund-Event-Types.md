## Proration Methodology

When an expense benefits both foreign and domestic participants:

### Formula
```
K Fund Amount = Total Cost × (Foreign Guests ÷ Total Guests)
```

### Example
- Total catering cost: $10,000
- Total guests: 100
- Foreign officials: 40
- K Fund allowable: $10,000 × (40/100) = $4,000

### Documentation
Proration calculations must be documented with:
- Total guest count
- Foreign guest count (with names/titles)
- Calculation methodology
- Approval signature
