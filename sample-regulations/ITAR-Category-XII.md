# ITAR Category XII - Fire Control, Range Finder, Optical and Guidance and Control Equipment

## § 121.1 Category XII

### (a) Fire control systems

Fire control systems, including:
- Gun fire control systems
- Missile fire control systems  
- Bomb fire control systems
- Integration software and hardware

### (b) Optical sighting devices

(1) Telescopic sights and optical sights specifically designed for military use

(2) Night vision devices including:
- Image intensification systems
- Thermal imaging systems
- Infrared viewers

### (c) Thermal imaging equipment

Thermal imaging cameras and systems that:

(1) Have a peak response in the wavelength range exceeding 3,000 nm but not exceeding 30,000 nm

(2) Have thermal sensitivity better than 0.1°C at 300K

(3) Incorporate focal plane arrays with more than 256 x 256 elements

**Note:** Commercial thermal imaging equipment with specifications below these thresholds may be subject to EAR rather than ITAR.

### (d) Laser systems

Laser rangefinders, laser designators, and laser target markers specifically designed for military use.

### (e) Military GPS receivers

GPS receivers specifically designed or modified for military use, including:

(1) Receivers capable of providing navigation at speeds in excess of 1,000 knots and altitudes above 60,000 feet

(2) Receivers with anti-jamming capabilities

(3) Receivers using military GPS signals (P(Y) code, M-code)

**Note:** Commercial GPS receivers not meeting these specifications are typically subject to EAR.

### (f) Guidance and control equipment

Inertial navigation systems, guidance sets, and control systems specifically designed for missiles, rockets, or unmanned aerial vehicles.

## Licensing Requirements

### Significant Military Equipment (SME)

The following items in Category XII are designated as SME:

- Night vision systems with Gen 3 or better image intensifiers
- Thermal imaging systems exceeding specified thresholds
- Military GPS receivers with anti-jam capabilities
- Laser target designators

### End-Use Certificates

Exports of SME items require end-use certificates from the importing country's government.

## Common Compliance Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Commercial Thermal Cameras

**Question:** Are commercial thermal cameras for industrial inspection ITAR-controlled?

**Analysis:** 
- Check thermal sensitivity (must be better than 0.1°C at 300K for ITAR)
- Check array size (must exceed 256 x 256 for ITAR)
- Check wavelength range
- If below thresholds, likely EAR jurisdiction

### Scenario 2: GPS for Drones

**Question:** Is GPS equipment for commercial drones ITAR-controlled?

**Analysis:**
- Check if receiver operates above 60,000 feet AND 1,000 knots
- Check for military signal capability (P(Y), M-code)
- Check for anti-jamming features
- Commercial receivers typically EAR, not ITAR
