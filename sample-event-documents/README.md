## Key Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Presidential vs. Secretary Hospitality
The seating chart and program clearly show the President as primary host, with the Secretary providing diplomatic support. Food and beverage should be EOP-funded.

### Scenario 2: Mandatory EDCS Items
Gifts to foreign dignitaries (crystal vases) must be EDCS-funded per 22 U.S.C. § 2694, regardless of who presents them.

### Scenario 3: Operational vs. Representational
Technical equipment (lighting, A/V, interpretation) enables the event but isn't received by guests - should be DP-funded.

### Scenario 4: Co-Hosted Elements
The Secretary delivers a toast and has a holding room - these representational functions should be EDCS-funded.

### Scenario 5: Legal Review Triggers
Photography and commemorative items serve mixed purposes and should be flagged for legal review.
